Greeting's to myself.

It's 17:24pm.
Purchased a Adobe [[Photoshop]] course on Udemy.

Adobe [[Photoshop]] left on downloading in chrome.

Task for the day: 
- grab a cup of caffeine to start with.
- Setup Adobe [[Photoshop]] 2022 on the system.
- Get started with the [[Interior Design Studio]] project. 
- Take a short break of 15 mins when needed. 
- Hit 30 Pushups.

Good luck to me.
