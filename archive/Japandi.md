_Japandi_ Design is the combination of [[Scandinavian]] functionality & [[Japanese]] rustic minimalism to create a felling of art, nature & simplicity.
## Intro

- Japandi design isn't sparse—it's intentional.
- The fusion of [[Scandinavian]] & [[Japanese]] styles creates the perfect blend of function and form, focusing on clean lines, bright spaces, and light colors.
- The perfect fusion of [Japanese](https://www.thespruce.com/what-is-japanese-architecture-4782377) and Scandinavian, Japandi design focuses on minimalistic designs that are aesthetically pleasing yet highly functional.
- Japandi Style often emphasizes sustainability. 
- The prevalence of natural materials & simple designs make it a great green decor style.

## Elements of [[Japandi]]
- [[Plethora]] of natural materials.
- muted colors
- clean lines
- [[Minimal]], yet well-curated [[furnishings]].

	- Neutral Colors and paint on furniture & accessories 
	- Calming, tranquil & peaceful palettes 
	- Brighter colors are incorporated so meaningfully and subtly.

## How does both style works together?
- In Scandi design, there's the notion of "[[hygge]] " This is the Scandinavian concept of coziness in design. Basically, your home should be your sanctuary and provide a feeling of comfort every time you walk in the front door. 
- On fusing the Scandinavian notion '[[hygge]]' with the Japanese notion '[[Wabi-sabi]]' to the idea that there is beauty in imperfection and you create the design marriage that is JAPANDI .
- Japanese & Scandinavian Styles works together so well because they are both rooted in minimalism & comfort.
- The shared aesthetics of the two comes together & forms a style that is both easygoing and sophisticated. 
-  And where the two diverge, their differences actually complement each other. 
-  Where Japanese interiors are sleek, [[Nordic Countries]] ones are rustic. 

## How to decorate in Japandi Style

- The play is to create a sense of outdoor living. 
- Focus on bringing natural materials(unfinished wood or bamboo pieces) into your home to get a look of it.
- Use of [[Muted colors]] with accent or hint of pale green or bringing plants and greenery.
- Reducing clutter(Clean lines & open Spaces)
- [[Faux Minimalism]] with natural containers such as boxes & baskets, built-ins or folding screens to hide the excess stuff. 
- To get the best of both the designs, draw on the coziness of Scandi Design with warm textures & soft pieces while maintaining the elegance of Japanese decor.  
- Look for pieces that will stand the test of time and work with your decor for years to come. Focus on pieces that are sustainable and safe for our planet.
